This is a README file for AgriApp, the purpose of this application is to facilitate the computation of rental expenses associated with diverse farm machinery. Users will have the option to designate a numerical code corresponding to a particular machine type from a list. Subsequently, they will be prompted to input the commencement and conclusion hours for which they plan to lease the chosen equipment. It's essential to emphasize that the initiation hour must consistently precede the conclusion hour, ensuring a valid time frame.
